In the past year, there has been a dramatic influx of scam messages arriving at people's phones regarding a supposed "toll notice." I received many myself, all with the following message, verbatum:

**Toll Violation Notice:**

This is your **final notice** regarding this unpaid toll balance on your account. You **must settle** the balance within the **next 12 hours** to avoid **severe penalties**.

Unpaid: $2.17
Due Date: April 19, 2025

Failure to pay within this time frame will result in the following:

1. **Immediate addition of late payment fees** to your balance
2. **Suspension of your vehicle registration** by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)
3. Collection actions, including a **negative report to your credit file**

Please make your payment promptly to **avoid these severe consequences and protect your driving privileges**.

Pay Now:

If the link fails, reply with 'Y', exit the SMS, and reopen it to activate the link, or copy and paste it directly into your browser to complete your payment.

<span style="color:blue">**This is your last opportunity. Pay now to avoid irreversible consequences**</span>.

... if this was true, I had likely incurred enough debt to warrant leaving the country. So, I sat down to look into it. 

Even with an initial look-over of the message, we see enough **red flags** to ruin the strongest budding relationship: we cann see almost every telltale mark of phishing, from introducing a sense of extreme urgency to a suspicious link.
