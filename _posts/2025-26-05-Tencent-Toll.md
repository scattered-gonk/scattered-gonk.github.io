In the past year, there has been a dramatic influx of scam messages arriving at people's phones regarding a supposed "toll notice." I received many myself, all with the following message, verbatum:

<span style="color:red"> **Toll Violation Notice:** </span>

This is your <span style="color:red"> **final notice** </span> regarding this unpaid toll balance on your account. You <span style="color:red"> **must settle** </span> the balance within the <span style="color:red"> **next 12 hours** </span> to avoid <span style="color:red"> **severe penalties** </span>.

Unpaid: $2.17
Due Date: April 19, 2025

Failure to pay within this time frame will result in the following:

1. <span style="color:red"> **Immediate addition of late payment fees** </span> to your balance
2. <span style="color:red"> **Suspension of your vehicle registration** </span> by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)
3. Collection actions, including a <span style="color:red"> **negative report to your credit file** </span>

Please make your payment promptly to<span style="color:red"> **avoid these severe consequences and protect your driving privileges** </span>.

If the link fails, reply with 'Y', exit the SMS, and reopen it to activate the link, or copy and paste it directly into your browser to complete your payment.

<span style="color:red"> **This is your last opportunity. Pay now to avoid irreversible consequences** </span>.

... if this was true, I had likely incurred enough debt to warrant leaving the country. Just in case, I sat down to look into the crime I had committed. 

Even with an initial look-over of the message, we see enough **red flags** to ruin the strongest budding relationship: we cann see almost every telltale mark of phishing, from introducing a sense of extreme urgency to a suspicious link.
