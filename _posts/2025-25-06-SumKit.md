<h1> SumKit </h1>

A new strain of phishing kit has entered the market -- one with a consistent mispelling littered throughout its code:

```js
sendData({
        "type": "sumbit_card",
        "arg": arg
    });
...
sendData({
        "type": "sumbit_code",
        "arg": {
            "code": code
        }
    });
```
in lieu of this pattern, we've decided to give the moniker of <b>SumKit</b> to this new template.

<h1> Overview </h1>

SumKit is a phishing template that follows in the stead of a bulk of its predecessors, warning victims of a supposed toll payment violation. When navigated to on a mobile device, the site purports to be a Bureau of Motor Vehicles portal and asks for basic victim info (name, address, etc.) along with their credit card information.

<h2> Baking Information Into Cookies </h2>

In order to exfiltrate victim data, SumKit encodes any entered information into Base64 and stores the result in a variety of cookies. Namely:

```js
5B0B164A2EC93DFA9A79696DE5FBDFB4 => eyJiMSI6IkJvYmJ5In0=         => {"b1":"Bobby"}
                                    //stores history of entered data in shorthand format in the event of a reloaded page
2ADF521149526DDE524F030851C7F903 => cGFnZUNhcmQ=                  => "pageCard"
                                    //stores the current page the user is on
0A2428FDB84C7E7E2BFE5D5A6B52F84A => eyJiYXNlSW5mbzAiOiJCb2JieSJ9 => {"baseInfo0":"Bobby"}
                                    //all of the currently entered data
```
