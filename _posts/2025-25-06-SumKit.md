<h1> SumKit </h1>

A new strain of phishing kit has entered the market -- one with a consistent mispelling littered throughout its code:

```js
sendData({
        "type": "sumbit_card",
        "arg": arg
    });
...
sendData({
        "type": "sumbit_code",
        "arg": {
            "code": code
        }
    });
```
in lieu of this pattern, we've decided to give the moniker of <b>SumKit</b> to this new template.

<h1> Overview </h1>

SumKit is a phishing template that follows in the stead of a bulk of its predecessors, warning victims of a supposed toll payment violation. When navigated to on a mobile device, the site purports to be a Bureau of Motor Vehicles portal and asks for basic victim info (name, address, etc.) along with their credit card information.
